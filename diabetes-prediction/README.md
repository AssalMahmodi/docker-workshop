#### This code builds a diagnostic tool for diabetes prediction. It first imports data on various factors potentially linked to diabetes, then separates this data into features (like blood sugar) and the target variable (presence or absence of diabetes). Using a Logistic Regression model, the code trains a machine learning algorithm to identify connections between these features and the likelihood of diabetes. After training, the model is saved for later use. Finally, the code defines a function that allows users to input their own data points, which the trained model then analyzes to predict whether the user is likely to have diabetes.
